# Seperator
- I extracted only the *cs.ds* research paper files from the Arxiv file that had been given from the link.
- From that I have choosen 1000 data files to train my model
- My model secured over 94% in the training.
# Train_stream
- Train_stream.py is the streamlit model which will give the output screen.
- In the left sidebar there will be a choosing option for the research paper details that will help the researchers
- Based on the question you ask the model will provide the output from the trained model (pkl, keras)
